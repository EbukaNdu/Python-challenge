# python-challenge
i got help from my tutor with understanding the differences between (), [], and {}
i referenced the soulution files in census class activities that grant posted on slack  
Cross referenced my work with chatgpt to fix my work and explain to me why i was getting errors on my code especially when it came to using csv.DictReader over csv.reader because it was easier to write the column name vs the number for less confusion
